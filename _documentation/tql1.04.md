  The Technopedia query language (TQL) is used with the TQL endpoint to query data in the Technopedia database. <br>
  TQL is the graph-query language that you use to query the database. The graph database stores connections between nodes as first-class citizens so it doesn't have to compute relationships at query time, which makes it more efficient than a relational database.

  ###### TQL is a declarative query language that allows you to specify what data you want to retrieve by using the query language to query nodes and relationships in the Technopedia database.



  #### Get started with TQL<br>

  To create a query by using TQL, you must create a MATCH statement, which is similar to a Select statement in SQL.<br>
  For example, `MATCH (software:SOFTWARE_RELEASE) RETURN software`<br>
  
  You append the MATCH query statement as a query parameter to the TQL endpoint.<br>
  For example, `https://v6.technopedia.com/tql?q=<MATCH query statement>`
  <br>
  
  The TQL MATCH statement returns results from one or more nodes and relationships that you specify in the query. Typically, the query results are returned in key-value pairs, which resembles the format in the following image: <br>
   <br>
  
  ![API Image](/images/results.png)<br>&nbsp;
  <br>  
  
  #### Components of a TQL MATCH query<br>

  To create a MATCH statement, you need some or all of the following components:
  
  * MATCH <br>
    The MATCH clause introduces the statement like SELECT in SQL and is the first input.<br> 
    You use MATCH to select a node in Technopedia.<br>
    `MATCH` <br>
  * Node <br>
    Typically, you refer to a node in the graph as your source of data for the query.<br> 
    Nodes in a query are predeced by a (:) colon. <br>
    `MATCH (:node)` <br>
  * Alias <br>
    To enable the `RETURN` clause to return data from a node, you append an alias to the node, for example, 'MATCH (alias:node)'. <br>
    TQL binds the unique alias to the node so that you can refer to that alias in the Return clause of <br>
    the MATCH query to request specific data. <br>
    `MATCH (alias:node) RETURN alias` <br>
    You can also use the alias to specify specific node attributes that you want to return. <br>
    `MATCH (alias:node) RETURN alias.attribute1, alias.attribute2` <br>
  * Relationship <br>
    To get data from more than one node in a query, you must use a relationship to connect the nodes. <br>
    You don't need to append an alias to the relationship, unless, you want to get data back from that relationship. <br>
    `MATCH (aliasx:node1)-[:RELATED_TO]->(aliasy:node2), RETURN aliasx, aliasy` <br>
  * Relationship direction <br>
    The direction of the relationship is shows the relationship from node to node. <br> 
    An arrow in the query shows a unidirectional relationship, and no arrows indicate a birdirectional relationship. <br>
    For example, node_software is manufactured_by node_manufacturer <br>
    `(:node_software)-[:MANUFACTURED_BY]->(:node_manufacturer)` <br>
    Typically, relationships are unidirectional but they can be bidirectional. <br>
    A bidirectional relationship is represented without an arrow, for example, <br>
    `(:node_software)-[:MANUFACTURED_BY]-(:node_manufacturer)`<br>
  * RETURN <br>
    The RETURN clause defines the data that you want to get back by referring to the alias. <br>
    `MATCH (aliasx:node1) RETURN aliasx` to return all attributes for that node <br>
    `MATCH (aliasx:node1) RETURN aliasx.attribute_xyz` to return only data for `attribute_xyz` from `node1` <br>




  
  <br>
  The following examples are based on the nodes and relationship in the diagram:
  <br>
  
  ![API Image](/images/simple_match.png)<br>&nbsp;
  <br>  
  `MATCH (alias:SOFTWARE_EDITON) RETURN alias` <br>
  `MATCH (x:SOFTWARE_EDITON) RETURN x.edition` <br>
  `MATCH (y:SOFTWARE_PRODUCT) RETURN y` <br>
  `MATCH (sp:SOFTWARE_PRODUCT) RETURN sp.product` <br>

  `MATCH (z:SOFTWARE_EDITON)-[HAS_A]->(k:SOFTWARE_PRODUCT) RETURN z, k.product` <br>
  Returns all attributes for software editon and related products by product name. <br>
  <br>
  The following TQL query shows the most common components of a MATCH statement:

  #### Overview of creating a MATCH query<br>


  The following diagram shows a broad outline of creating a query:
  <br>
  
  ![API Image](/images/match.png)<br>&nbsp;
  <br>  
  

  <br>
  Use the following guidelines to help you to build a basic query:

   1.	Identify the relevant node or nodes that store the data you want to retrieve.<br>
   2.	Identify any node attributes that you want to target for your data, for example, you use the product
        attribute of the software product node to get names of software products. <br>   
   3.	For queries that involve more than one node, identify any relationships that connect the nodes.<br>
   4.   Note any conditions that you want to apply to filter the data.
   5.	Write your MATCH statement

  To view a list of attributes for any node, you use the 
  `MATCH (alias:NODE) RETURN alias` query with the TQL endpoint.
  For example, `https://v6-1.technopedia.com/tql?q=MATCH (n:SOFTWARE_PRODUCT) RETURN n LIMIT 1`
  {: .info}

  <br>
  Here’s some examples:
  <br>
  <b>Query Intent:</b> To find software products that contain Adobe in their product name.<br>

  The Software Product node has an attribute named product that lists the product name.<br>
  View the list of attributes that you can use on the Software Product page, or you can use <br>
  `MATCH(x:SOFTWARE_PRODUCT) RETURN x` to get a list of attributes. <br>

    1. Use the MATCH clause to select the `SOFTWARE_PRODUCT` because it
       has the `product` attribute with a product (name) field.<br>
       `MATCH (:SOFTWARE_PRODUCT)`
    2. Add an alias to the node, so that you can use it with the RETURN clause to get data from that node. <br>
       You place the alias before the colon.
       `MATCH (s:SOFTWARE_PRODUCT)`  
    3. Use the `WHERE` clause with the `CONTAINS` clause to specify the condition `product CONTAINS "Adobe"`.<br>
       `WHERE s.product CONTAINS "Adobe"`
    4. Refer to the alias in the RETURN clause to list software products that contain Adobe in the product name.  <br>
       `MATCH (s:SOFTWARE_PRODUCT) WHERE s.product CONTAINS "Adobe" Return s`

  <br>
  In this example, software products that have Adobe in the product field are returned. The following sample return shows two results for Adobe.<br>
  <br>
  ![API Image](/images/adobe_contains.png)<br>&nbsp;
  <br>  
  
 
   You must add an alias before the colon for nodes that you reference with the RETURN clause in the MATCH statement. The return clause references the alias to generate the query ouput.

  <br>

  The following diagram shows the software nodes and the relationship directions.
  <br>
  
  ![API Image](/images/sw_graph.png)<br>&nbsp;
  <br>  
  
  
   For any queries that use relationships, follow the relationship direction in the node graph.
   {: .warning}

  <br>
  <b>Query Intent:</b> To get software editions named "Enterprise Developer" and where the edition order is equal to two.  <br>
  In this query, you only have to query the software edition node.
    
    1. Use `MATCH` to select the software edtion node, and add an alias (se) to the node that you refer to in the `RETURN` clause.<br>
      `MATCH (se:SOFTWARE_EDITION)`
    2. Use the WHERE and AND clauses to add conditions that filter the output.<br>
      `MATCH (alias:SOFTWARE_EDITION) WHERE s.order = 2 AND s.edition = "Enterprise Developer"`<br>
    3. You use the `RETURN` clause to select the query output by referring to the alias and attributes.<br>
      `RETURN s.edition, s.order, s.technopedia_id`  

  <br>
  In this query example, you return software editions in Technopedia by edition, order, and Technopedia ID: <br>

  `MATCH (s:SOFTWARE_EDITION) WHERE s.order = 2 AND s.edition = "Enterprise Developer" RETURN s.edition, s.order, s.technopedia_id`<br>
  <br>
  ![API Image](/images/edition_query.png)<br>&nbsp;
  <br>  

  <b>Query Intent:</b> To get any five software editions and product names that are associated with those editions.<br>
  You must query the software product and software edition nodes.<br>

    1. Use `MATCH` to select the software edtion node, and add node aliases to use in the `RETURN` clause.<br>
       `MATCH (s:SOFTWARE_EDITION)`
    2. Add the `HAS_A` relationship from edition to product and note the direction of the relationship in the diagram.<br>
      `MATCH (s:SOFTWARE_EDITION)-[:HAS_A]->(p:SOFTWARE_PRODUCT)`<br>
       You must add an alias for software product becuause you use the alias (p) in the return clause to return the product name.  
    3. You use the `RETURN` clause to select the query output by referring to the alias and attributes.<br>
       You use the attributes edition from software edition and product from the software product node.<br> 
       `RETURN s.edition, p.product` or you can return all attributes by using `RETURN s, p` <br>  
    4. To limit the number of results, you use the `LIMIT` clause to limit the results to five or any number that you want.<br>   

        
   ![API Image](/images/ed_to_prod.png)<br>&nbsp;
  <br>
  In this query example, you return five software editions in Technopedia by edition and product name: <br>

  `MATCH (s:SOFTWARE_EDITION)-[:HAS_A]->(p:SOFTWARE_PRODUCT) RETURN s.edition, p.product LIMIT 5`<br>

  <br>
  ![API Image](/images/prod_ed.png)<br>&nbsp;
  <br>  
    
  #### TQL Clauses and Operators<br>

  Use the following clauses and operators in your MATCH statements to filter Technopedia data:

  * WHERE, <br>
  Use the `WHERE` clause to filter results. <br>
  `MATCH (s:SOFTWARE_PRODUCT) WHERE s.product = "Office"  RETURN s` <br>
  Return software products where the product field is equal to 'Office'. <br>

  * AND <br>
  Use the AND clause to add an addtional filter.<br>
  `MATCH (s:SOFTWARE_PRODUCT) WHERE s.product = "Office" AND s.family = "HealthMatics"  RETURN s` <br>
  Return software products where product name is Office and the family is HealthMatics. <br>

  * OR <br>
  Use the OR clause to  return either one of two condtions. <br>
  `MATCH (s:SOFTWARE_PRODUCT) WHERE s.product = "Office" OR s.product = "HealthMatics" RETURN s ` <br>
  Return software products where product name is Office or HealthMatics. <br>
  
  * LIMIT <br>
  Limit the number of results that are returned by specifiying a number with the LIMIT clause. <br>
  `MATCH (s:SOFTWARE_PRODUCT) RETURN s LIMIT 5` <br>

  * CONTAINS <br>
  Use the CONTAINS clause to search for words that are contained within an attribute field. <br>
  `MATCH (s:SOFTWARE_PRODUCT) WHERE s.product CONTAINS "Microsoft" RETURN s` <br>

  * DISTINCT <br>
  Return distinct records only. <br>
  `MATCH (s:SOFTWARE_PRODUCT) WHERE s.product = "Microsoft Exchange Server Monitor" RETURN DISTINCT s` <br>

  * COUNT <br>
  Return count of records. <br>
  `MATCH (s:SOFTWARE_PRODUCT) RETURN count(*)` <br>

  * AS <br>
  Return output as another name. <br>
  `MATCH (n:SOFTWARE_EDITION) RETURN n.edition as ED, n.modified_at as MOD` <br>

  * Operators <br>
  `=` equals <br>
  `<>` not equal to <br>
  `>` greater than <br>
  `<` less than <br>
  `>=` greater than or equals <br>
  `<=` less than or equals <br>






 
  To use the MATCH statements in the following examples, you append the MATCH statement to the following tql endpoint and make a GET request from a API client or use cURL. <br>
