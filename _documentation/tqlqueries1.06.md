  TQL queries can be based on a single node or multiple nodes where you need to include relationships to get data from multiple nodes. For many TQL queries, you have to use relationships to query several Technopedia nodes. Relationships might seem complex but their function is mainly to connect nodes.
content_markdown: |-
  ###### Because TQL is a declarative query language, you can build your query with multiple nodes, relationships, attributes, and add multiple conditions to refine your query.<br>
  

  You can use an alias or variable with a realtionship that has attributes when you want to return data for those attributes. TQL binds the alias that you specify to that relationship, which you can use with the Return clause of the MATCH query to get specific data.

  #### Building relationships in a query<br>

  
  ###### Relationships provide a way of getting related data from multiple nodes in one query. You connect the nodes by using the relationship that's shown in the database graph. <br>
  
  {: .info}

  Note the direction of the relationship in the graph. If you specify an incorrect direction, you might not get data from the nodes that you want to connect with.

  
  

  The following image shows examples of types of relationships and their directions.

  #### Examples of building relationshipsR<br>   

  <br>
  To incoporate multiple nodes in a MATCH statement you must use the realations to connect the nodes and then use the RETURN clause to get data from any of the nodes in the query. Use the following guide to help you to build your query:

   1.	Select the Nodes that you want to use in your query.<br>
   2.	Identify the node attributes that store the information you require.<br>
   3.	Select any relationships to connect to nodes that hold your required data.<br>
   4.	Write your MATCH statement

  <br>
  Hereâ€™s some examples that are based on the software nodes and manufacturer node:
  <br>
  ![API Image](/images/sw_relat.png)<br>&nbsp;
  <br>  

  <b>Query Intent:</b> Get software that is manufactured by Oracle and return manufactuer, product name, version, releasea, and edition.br>

    * The start node is manufacturer.<br>
    * Use MATCH to select the `MANUFACTURER` node and then connect to the software product, software `product`  <br>
      by using relationships.
    ![API Image](/images/relat_overview.png)<br>&nbsp;
    * Return data by using the aliases in that are assigned to the nodes in the MATCH statement.<br>
    <br>  
    Here's the query that you use:
    `MATCH (m:MANUFACTURER)<-[:HAS_A]-(sp:SOFTWARE_PRODUCT)<-[:HAS_A]-(sv:SOFTWARE_VERSION)<-[:HAS_A]-(sr:SOFTWARE_RELEASE)-[:HAS_A]->(se:SOFTWARE_EDITION) WHERE m.manufacturer = "Oracle" RETURN m.manufacturer, sp.product, sv.version, sr.release, se.edition LIMIT 5`
    
    
  <br>
  `MATCH (s:SOFTWARE_PRODUCT) WHERE s.product = "Adobe" Return s`

  <br>
  In this example, software products that have Adobe in the name fields are returned.<br>

  <br>
  <br>

   You must add an alias before the colon in nodes that you want to get data from statement so that you can  refer to this alias in the return clause to specify the query ouput.
   {: .warning}
  
   
  <br>  
  <br>

   When you write MATCH statements that use relationships, you must follow the relationship direction in the diagram.
   {: .warning}

  <br>
  <b>Objective:</b> To get software editions that have a release, verison, and product.<br>

    * To get the required information, you have to add relationships to the software release, software version, and software product nodes.<br>
    * We use MATCH to select the software edtion node and then create relationships to the other nodes.<br>
    * Add an alias to each node and relationship in the  query.<br>
    * To return the data that you need, use the Return clause to refer to the specific aliases.<br>
  <br>
  In this query example, you return software editions in Technopedia with release, verison, and product information. <br>

  `MATCH (e:SOFTWARE_EDITION)<-[x:HAS_A]-(r:SOFTWARE_RELEASE)-[y:HAS_A]->(v:SOFTWARE_VERSION)-[z:HAS_A]->(p:SOFTWARE_PRODUCT) RETURN r,e,v,p`<br>

  <br>
  
  <br>
   
  <b>Query Intent:</b> Get software editions and include the release, verison, product, and manufacturer.<br>
  <br>
  In this query example, you get data for software editions in Technopedia, and include the release, version, product, and manufacturer data for each edition that is listed. <br>

  `MATCH (e:SOFTWARE_EDITION)<-[:HAS_A]-(r:SOFTWARE_RELEASE)-[:HAS_A]->(v:SOFTWARE_VERSION)-[:HAS_A]->(p:SOFTWARE_PRODUCT)<-[:HAS_A]-(m:MANUFACTURER) RETURN e,r,v,p,m LIMIT 10`<br>

  
  <br>

  #### TQL extended relationships<br>


  Here are some examples of extended relationships that connect multiple nodes:

  <b>Query Intent:</b> 

 
 
  The following MATCH query examples show variations in constructions that use relationships and other conditions. To try out a query example, you append the MATCH statement to the following tql endpoint and make a GET request from a API client or use cURL. <br>
