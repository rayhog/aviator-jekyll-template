  ###### The Techopedia version 6 API enables cloud-based access to asset data in Technopedia to provide a cloud-first, high-performance resource for customers.

  ###### You can use the API with TQL (Technopedia query language), which is a graph-based query language that you use to query the Technopedia database.<br>

  ###### Version 6 Technopedia query language uses API graph databases, which are designed to process data by using a graph-based methodology, rather than the relational database model. 
  You query the Technopedia database by using the graph-based Technopedia query language (TQL) to select nodes and attributes of those nodes to refine the query and return relevant data. For example, you might query the software product node and include the title property to return titles of software products.<br><p></p>

  ###### The following query is an example of a GET request with a graph query, which is like a Select statement in SQL, which selects the software node and returns titles of software products.<br>
  
  `GET:` `https://v6.technopedia.com/tql?MATCH (n:SOFTWARE_PRODUCT) RETURN n.title`<br>



  #### Whatâ€™s included in Technopedia V6 API?


  * Graph store organization model that enables Technopedia to store asset data
  from any entity.

  * TQL (Technopedia Query Language) endpoint that you use for graph-based
  querying of the Technopedia database.

  * Technopedia-id endpoint that you use to look any Technopedia product by its ID.


  #### What are the V6 API Endpoints?


  ###### To query the Technopedia database you use the following endpoints:


  * `https://v6.technopedia.com/tql?q=MATCH [Query Parameters]`

    ###### You provide query parameters to the MATCH statement to generate the criteria for your query, as in the following example:

  * `https://v6.technopedia.com/technopedia-id/[Technopedia ID]`

    ###### You provide the Technopedia ID for the product that you're querying to return data for that specific product, as in the following example:

    ![API Image](/images/tid.png){: .img-responsive}

  #### TQL graph concepts


  ###### The following concepts are involved in the storage of data is stored in
  Technopedia


  * Nodes are Graph data records that are entities in the graph, such as
  software version or hardware. Nodes contain attributes, which are key-value
  pairs.

  * Attributes are properties of a node and they store data in key-value pairs,
  such as '{name Joe}'

  * Relationships provide a connection between nodes. Relationships have a start
  node, end node, a type, and a direction. For example, the nodes apple and an
  orchard have a relationship in the graph which is named 'grows\_in'. Apple is
  the start node; orchard is the end node; 'grows\_in' is the relationship and
  the direction is apple to orchard.


  ###### The following diagram is an example of how Nodes and Relationships are
  connected:
