  Technopedia version 6.1 API enables cloud-based access to asset data in Technopedia, which provides you with a cloud-first and high-performance resource to manage your assets.<br>
  Technopedia is a Graph database that is designed to process data by using a graph-based methodology, rather than a relational database model.<br>
  <br>
  You query the Technopedia database by using either of the following methods:

  * By using the graph-based Technopedia query language (TQL) endpoint. <br>
  You select nodes, node relationships to other nodes, and node attributes to define the criteria for your query to return relevant data. 
  * By using the Techopedia-ID endpoint to reference an entity in the database and return relevant data for that entity. <br>
  The Technopedia ID record stores information about a Technopedia entity. <br>
  For example; the entity might be a product or it might be specific node attribute that returns relevant data.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  ######
  The following diagram shows an overview of the Technopedia API enpoints, and examples of nodes and relationships in the Technopedia database.

  <br>

  The following query example is an API GET request that uses the TQL endpoint. <br>
  <br>
  `GET:` `https://v6-1.technopedia.com/tql?=MATCH (n:SOFTWARE_PRODUCT) RETURN n.product` <br>

  The query selects the software product node and then returns software product names.<br>
  TQL uses a `MATCH` statement to select nodes in the Technopedia graph, which is like a `SELECT` statement in SQL. <br>
  <br>
  



  #### Whatâ€™s included in Technopedia V6 API?


  * Graph store organization model that enables Technopedia to store asset data
  from any entity.

  * TQL (Technopedia Query Language) endpoint that you use for graph-based
  querying of the Technopedia database.

  * Technopedia-id endpoint that you use to query any Technopedia entity by its ID.


  #### What are the V6 API Endpoints?


  ###### To query the Technopedia database you use one of the following two endpoints:


  * `https://v6-1.technopedia.com/tql?q=MATCH <Query Parameters>`
    ###### You provide query parameters in the TQL MATCH statement to generate the criteria for your query, as shown in the following example:<br>
    
    GET: `https://v6-1.technopedia.com/tql?q=MATCH (sft:SOFTWARE_PRODUCT) RETURN sft`<br>

  * `https://v6-1.technopedia.com/technopedia-id/<Technopedia ID>.`
    ###### You provide the Technopedia ID for the entity that you're querying to return data for that specific entity. 
    The following example shows a dummy Technopedia ID: <br>
    
    GET: `https://v6-1.technopedia.com/technopedia-id/86-7ytdf89jdjhjsdh87`
   

  #### Technopedia graph concepts

  ###### Data storage in Technopedia involves the following concepts:


  * Nodes are Graph data records that are entities in the graph, such as
  software version or hardware product.                 
    
  * Nodes contain one or more attributes, which provide data in key-value
  pairs such as the following examples: <br>
  `{product: Excel}` or `{manufacturer: Microsoft}`.

  * Nodes are connected by relationships that you use to query multiple nodes in a single query.
