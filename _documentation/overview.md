  ###### The Technopedia version 6 API enables cloud-based access to asset data in Technopedia that provides you with a cloud-first, high-performance resource to manage your assets.
  ###### You can use the API with TQL (Technopedia query language), which is a graph-based query language that you use to query the Technopedia database. Graph databases are designed to process data by using a graph-based methodology, rather than the relational database model.
  <br>
  ###### You query the Technopedia database by using the graph-based Technopedia query language (TQL) to select nodes and attributes of those nodes to define the criteria for your query and return relevant data. 
  <br>
  The following diagram  shows an overview of the Technopedia API and how it queries the Technopedia database.

  ###### The following query is an example of a GET request with a graph query, which is like a `SELECT` statement in SQL, which selects the software node and then returns titles of software products.
  <br>
  `GET:` `https://v6.technopedia.com/tql?=MATCH (n:SOFTWARE_PRODUCT) RETURN n.title`<br>



  #### Whatâ€™s included in Technopedia V6 API?


  * Graph store organization model that enables Technopedia to store asset data
  from any entity.

  * TQL (Technopedia Query Language) endpoint that you use for graph-based
  querying of the Technopedia database.

  * Technopedia-id endpoint that you use to query any Technopedia product by its ID.


  #### What are the V6 API Endpoints?


  ###### To query the Technopedia database you use one of the following two endpoints:


  * `https://v6.technopedia.com/tql?q=MATCH <Query Parameters>`

    ###### You provide query parameters to the MATCH statement to generate the criteria for your query, as shown in the following example:

    ![API Image](/images/get_tql.png){: .img-responsive}

  * `https://v6.technopedia.com/technopedia-id/<Technopedia ID>.`

    ###### You provide the Technopedia ID for the product that you're querying to return data for that specific product, as in the following example:

    ![API Image](/images/tid.png){: .img-responsive}

  #### Technopedia query language (TQL) graph concepts

  ###### Data storage in Technopedia involves the following concepts:


  * Nodes are Graph data records that are entities in the graph, such as
  software version or hardware.                 
    
  * Nodes contain attributes, which provide data in key-value
  pairs such as `{title: Excel}` or `{manufacturer: Microsoft}`.

  * Nodes are connected by relationships that you use to query multiple nodes in a single query. 

  ###### The following diagram shows the nodes and relationships in the Technopedia database:
