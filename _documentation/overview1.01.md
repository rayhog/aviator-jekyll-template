  ###### The Technopedia version 6 API enables cloud-based access to asset data in Technopedia that provides you with a cloud-first, high-performance resource to manage your assets.

  ###### You can use the API with TQL (Technopedia query language), which is a graph-based query language that you use to query the Technopedia database. Graph databases are designed to process data by using a graph-based methodology, rather than the relational database model. <br>
  <br>

  ###### You query the Technopedia database by using the graph-based Technopedia query language (TQL) to select nodes and attributes of those nodes to define the criteria for your query and return relevant data. For example, you might query the `SOFTWARE_PRODUCT` node in Technopedia and specify the title attribute becasuse you want to return titles of software products. The following examplE is a TQL query that returns software titles:
  <br>
  `MATCH (s:SOFTWARE_PRODUCT) WHERE title = "Microsoft" RETURN s.title`
  <br>

  ###### The following query is an example of a GET request with a graph query, which is like a `SELECT` statement in SQL, which selects the software node and then returns titles of software products.<br>
  
  `GET:` `https://v6.technopedia.com/tql?MATCH (n:SOFTWARE_PRODUCT) RETURN n.title`<br>



  #### Whatâ€™s included in Technopedia V6 API?


  * Graph store organization model that enables Technopedia to store asset data
  from any entity.

  * TQL (Technopedia Query Language) endpoint that you use for graph-based
  querying of the Technopedia database.

  * Technopedia-id endpoint that you use to query any Technopedia product by its ID.


  #### What are the V6 API Endpoints?


  ###### To query the Technopedia database you use one of the following two endpoints:


  * `https://v6.technopedia.com/tql?q=MATCH [Query Parameters]`

    ###### You provide query parameters to the MATCH statement to generate the criteria for your query, as shown in the following example:

    ![API Image](/images/get_tql.png){: .img-responsive}

  * `https://v6.technopedia.com/technopedia-id/[Technopedia ID]`

    ###### You provide the Technopedia ID for the product that you're querying to return data for that specific product, as in the following example:

    ![API Image](/images/tid.png){: .img-responsive}

  #### Technopedia query language (TQL) graph concepts

  ###### The storage of data in Technopedia involves the following concepts:


  * Nodes are Graph data records that are entities in the graph, such as
  software version or hardware.                 
    
  * Nodes contain attributes, which are key-value
  pairs. Attributes are properties of a node and they store data in key-value pairs,
  such as `{title: Excel}` or `{manufacturer: Microsoft}`.

  * Relationships provide node to node connections. Relationships have a start
  node, end node, a type, and a direction. For example, the nodes organization and employee
  might have a relationship in the graph. An example of an relationship might be `Is_Employee_of`, which could be a relationship between employee and organization.

  If Joe is an employee of the organization then this relationship might be expressed in the following way:<br>

  The start node is employee; organization is the end node; `Is_Employee_of` is the relationship and
  the direction is employee to organization, which is determined by the arrow. The syntax of the query that defines the relationship might be expressed in the following way: <br>

  `MATCH (e:employee)-[Is_Employee_of]->(organization) WHERE e.person = "Joe" RETURN e`


  ###### The following diagram shows how Nodes and Relationships are
  connected:
