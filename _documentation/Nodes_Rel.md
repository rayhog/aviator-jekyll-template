  The Technopedia database is a graph database that uses graph structures for semantic queries with nodes, relationships, and attributes to represent the data.
  You access Technopedia data by querying nodes, attributes, or relationships in the Technopedia graph.<br>
  <br>
  
  Before you start using the Technopedia query language (TQL), it's important to be familiar with nodes, attributes, and relationships in the Technopedia database.
  

  #### Nodes in Technopedia
  
  Nodes represent entities that are equivalent to a data category such as hardware or software, and they are the main entity that you target when you query the Technopedia database. <br>
  For example, you query the manufacturer node to get manufacturer data, or the software product node to get software product data. <br>
  <br>
  The following list describes node charactertistics:

  <br> 
   * Represents data categories in Technopedia.
   * Have attributes that store data in key-value pairs, for example, `{"edition" : "server"}`.
   * Connect to other nodes through defined relationships.

   Here's some examples of nodes and relationships:

  <br>
   
  
  #### About Attributes 
  
  An attribute is an named value that is stored in a node but can be also be in a relationship. <br>
  For example, `{"product" : "Excel"}`  <br> 

  The nodeâ€™s attributes, for example, the edition attribute that belongs to software edition node are represented as key-value pairs within a pair of braces, for example: {edition: "Server"}. <br>
  <br>
  The following list shows some attributes that belong to the manufacturer node: <br>

   * technopedia_id
   * manufacturer
   * symbol

  #### Relationships connect nodes  

  Relationships connect nodes in the database, which enables you to include multiple nodes in a query by adding a node-to-node relationship. <br>
  For example, you might want to retrieve data for manufacturer, software edtion, and software product by making one query.
  <br>

  The following diagram shows a basic overview of some nodes and relationships in Technopedia:
