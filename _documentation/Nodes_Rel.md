  The Technopedia database is a graph database that uses graph structures for semantic queries with nodes, relationships, and attributes to represent the data.
  You access Technopedia data by querying nodes, attributes, relationships, or Technopedia IDs in the Technopedia graph.<br>
  <br>
  The graph database stores connections between nodes as first-class citizens so it doesnâ€™t have to compute relationships at query time, which makes it more efficient than a relational database.

  Before you start using the Technopedia query language (TQL), it's important to understand the node and relationship infrastructure of the Technopedia database.
  

  #### About Nodes in Technopedia
  
  Nodes are the main entity or data category that you refer to when you query the Technopedia database. For example, you query the manufacturer node to get manufacturer data, or the software product node to get software product data, which you can think of as a data category.

  Nodes can do the following things:

  <br> 
   * Represent and store categories of data in Technopedia.
   * Have attributes that store data in key-value pairs, for example, `{"edition" : "server"}`.
   * Connect to other nodes through relationships.

   Here's some examples of nodes in Technopedia:

  #### About Attributes in Technopedia graph database
  
  An Attribute is an named value that is stored in a node but can be also be in a relationship. <br>
  For example, `{"product" : "Excel"}`<br> 

  The following list shows some attributes that belong to the manufacturer node: <br>

   * technopedia_id
   * manufacturer
   * symbol

  #### Relationships connect nodes in Technopedia 

  ######
  Relationships provide semantically relevant connections between the Technopedia nodes.<br>
  The real power of TQL is its ability to create very specific queries that traverse nodes in the database by using relationships.<br>
  For example, you might want to retrieve data for manufacturer, software edtion, and software product by making one query.
  <br>
  The following information provides an overview of relationships in the Technopedia database:

   * Relationships connect nodes, for example, the software product node connects by the relationship: `HAS_A` to the manufacturer node.
   * Relationships have a type, such as `BELONGS_TO` and a direction, such as node x to node y. <br>
     An arrow determines the direction of the relationship. <br>
     For example `(node x)-[BELONGS_TO]->(node y)` but node y does not belong to node x. <br>
   * Typically, relationships  are unidirectional but they can be bidirectional, in which case, there's no arrow.
     For example `(node x)-[BELONGS_TO]-(node y)` <br>    
   * Relationships allow you to traverse the Technopedia nodes and retreive data from multiple nodes in one query by using TQL.
   * Like nodes, relationships can have attributes. 
     Typically, relationships have quantitative attributes, such as time intervals.
