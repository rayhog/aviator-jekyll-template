  The Technopedia database is a graph database that uses graph structures for semantic queries with nodes, relationships, and attributes to represent the data.
  You access Technopedia data by querying nodes, attributes, relationships, or Technopedia IDs in the Technopedia graph.<br>
  <br>
  The graph database stores connections between nodes as first-class citizens so it doesnâ€™t have to compute relationships at query time, which makes it more efficient than a relational database.
  

  #### About Nodes in Technopedia
  
  
  Nodes can have any number of attributes that store data as key-value-pairs, <br>
  for example, `{"edition" : "server"}`<br> 
   * Nodes are entities that store categories of data in Technopedia.
   * Nodes have attributes that store data in key-value pairs.
   * Nodes are connected to other nodes by relationships.
   * Node names are surrounded by parentheses in a query, for example, (Node).

   Here's some examples of nodes in Technopedia:

  <br>
   
  To get data from multiple nodes in one query, you use defined relationships to other nodes. 
  <br>
  
  #### About Attributes in Technopedia graph database
  
  Attributes belong to nodes and they represent and store data.<br>
  Attributes store data as (key-value-pairs). <br>
  For example, `{"product" : "Excel"}`<br> 

  The following list shows some attributes that belong to the manufacturer node: <br>

   * technopedia_id
   * manufacturer
   * symbol

  #### Relationships connect nodes in Technopedia 

  ######
  Relationships provide semantically relevant connections between the Technopedia nodes. <br>
  
  To get Technopedia data from multiple nodes in one query, you must use relationships to connect the nodes that you want to retrieve data from.
  For example, you might want data for manufacturer, software edtion, and software product in one query.

  The following information provides an overview of relationships in the Technopedia database:

   * Relationships connect nodes, for example, the software product node has the relationship: `[HAS_A]->` to the manufacturer node.
   * Relationships have a type, such as `BELONGS_TO` and a direction, such as node x to node y. <br>
     An arrow determines the direction of the relationship. <br>
     For example `(node x)-[BELONGS_TO]->(node y)` but node y does not belong to node s. <br>
   * Typically, relationships  are unidirectional but they can be bidirectional, in which case, there's no arrow.
     For example `(node x)-[BELONGS_TO]-(node y)` <br>    
   * Relationships allow you to traverse the Technopedia nodes and retreive data from multiple nodes in one query by using TQL.
   * Like nodes, relationships can have attributes. 
     Typically, relationships have quantitative attributes, such as time intervals.


  The following diagram is a basic overview of nodes and relationships:

  <br>

  In a query, nodes are surrounded by parenthesis and relationships are surrounded by square brackets as shown in the following example:
  <br>
  `Match (:node)-[:RELATIONSHIP]-> (:node)`
  
  <br>

   Note: You can only access data from Technopedia nodes that your subscription allows.
