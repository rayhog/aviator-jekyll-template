  The Technopedia database is a graph database that is based on nodes and relationships that connect those nodes.
  You access Technopedia data by referencing nodes, attributes, relationships, or Technopedia IDs in the Technopedia graph.<br>
  <br>
  The graph database stores connections between nodes as first-class citizens so it doesnâ€™t have to compute relationships at query time, which makes it more efficient than a relational database.
  

  #### About Nodes in Technopedia
  
  
  ###### Nodes are the entities in the Technopedia graph that store specific categories of data. <br>
  Nodes can have any number of attributes that store data as key-value-pairs, <br>
  for example, `{"edition" : "server"}`<br> 
   * Nodes are entities that store the Technopedia data.
   * Node names are surrounded by parentheses in a query, for example, (Node).
   * Nodes have attributes that show data in key-value pairs.
   * Nodes are connected to other nodes by relationships.

   Here's some examples of nodes in Technopedia:

  <br>
   
  To get data from multiple nodes in one query, you use defined relationships to other nodes. 
  <br>

  #### Relationships connect Nodes in Technopedia 

  ######
  Relationships provide semantically relevant connections between the Technopedia nodes. <br>
  
  To get Technopedia data from multiple nodes in one query, you must use relationships to connect nodes and define the criteria for the data that you want to extract from Technopedia.
  For example, you might want data for manufacturer, software edtion, and software product in a single query. To get data from these nodes, you must add relationships in your query to connect the nodes.

  The following information provides an overview of relationships in the Technopedia database:

   * Relationships have a type, such as `BELONGS_TO` and a direction, such as node x to node y. <br>
     An arrow determines the direction of the relationship. <br>
     For example `(node x)-[BELONGS_TO]->(node y)` <br>
   * Relationships often exist in a single direction but they can be bidirectional, in which case, there's no arrow.
     For example `(node x)-[BELONGS_TO]-(node y)` <br>    
   * Relationships connect the Technopedia database nodes, for example, the software product node has the relationship: `[HAS_A]->` to the manufacturer node.
   * Relationships allow you to traverse the Technopedia Nodes and by using the Technopedia query language, and to get data from the specified nodes in one query.
   * Like nodes, relationships can also have attributes. Typically, relationship have quantitative attributes, such as time intervals.
   * To get information about a relationship that has attributes, we can assign it an alias for later reference. The  alias is placed in front of the colon that precedes the relationship:<br>
    `-[anyAlias:Relationship_name]->(node)`


  The following diagram is a simple overview of nodes and relationships:

  <br>

  In a query, nodes are surrounded by parenthesis and relationships are surrounded by square brackets as shown in the following example:
  <br>
  `Match (:node)-[:RELATIONSHIP]-> (:node)`
  
  <br>
