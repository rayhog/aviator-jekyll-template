description: ### Version 6 API and the Technopedia Query Language
content_markdown: |-
  ###### The Techopedia version 6 API provides enhanced, cloud-based access to asset data in Technopedia. Technopedia uses the API with the graph-based query language to provide a cloud-first, high-performance resource for customers. <br>
  #### Whatâ€™s in Technopedia V6 API
  - Graph store organization model that enables Technopedia to store asset data from any industry.
  - TQL (Technopedia Query Language) endpoint that is used for graph-based querying of the Technopedia database.
  - Technopedia-id endpoint that you use to look any Technopedia product by ID.
  <br>
  #### TQL graph concepts
  <br>
  ###### The following concepts are involved in the storage of data is stored in Technopedia
  - Nodes are Graph data records that are entities in the graph, such as software version or hardware. Nodes contain attributes, which are key-value pairs.
  - Attributes are properties of  a node and they store data in key-value pairs, such as '{name Joe}' <br>
  - Relationship provide a connection between nodes. Relationships have a start node, end node, a type, and a direction. For example, the nodes apple and an orchard have a relationship in the graph which is named 'grows_in'. Apple is the start node; orchard is the end node; 'grows_in' is the relationship and the direction is apple to orchard.
  
  ###### Here's a diagram of how Nodes and Relationships work:
